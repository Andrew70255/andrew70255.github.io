I am a Computer Engineering Major, This is my first year at California State University Fullerton. 
I plan to graduate in 2028

## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, Part 1:

    Althought a pretty simple lab, It was my first time being introduced to the world of coding.
    I dont recall much from this lab but I struggled quite a bit while I saw my lab partner write the code effortlessly. 
    This lab was a great introduction to this course. The 'hello world!' program is the most used when learning how to code.

* Lab 5, Part 1:

    Another simple but not so simple lab. Part 1 of lab 5 covered the code of how to calculate an area of a rectangle. 
    I helped out my lab partner as well as writing the code, we switched positions every so often. 
    This Lab was lengthy and not finished in the time given in the lab but outside of class. 
    We were instructed to write code that would multiply the length and the width of a rectangle with the given parameters. 
    This lab is a sneak peek of what the code is written on online calculators.

* Lab 8, Part 2:

    The final lab part that stod out due to the use of loops.
    In part 2, we were instructed to create a pattern using the loop functions. 
    A use of a loops that I wouldnt have ever thought about. 
    A very simple lab but it was fun writing the complicated code that created this pattern
